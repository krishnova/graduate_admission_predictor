# GradAdmits - The Graduate Admissions Predictor App

>https://gradadmits.herokuapp.com/

## About the Project

An **end-to-end ML project** that predicts the chances of getting an admit in a University based on different features like *University Rating, Studentâ€™s Undergrad GPA,
GRE & TOEFL scores, Research experience and the quality of SOP & LOR*. It returns the chance of getting an admit in a particular university in *percentage* format.


## Description

Following algorithms were used:

* Linear Regression
* Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 
* Random Forest 
* Decision Tree 

**Linear Regression** had the highest accuracy among all the algorithms. Various Regression KPIs like *Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MSE), R-square (r2_score)* were analysed. In the end Linear Regression model was deployed due to lack of storage on Heroku. All other models can run locally.
